# LifeMapTools
Project to create a set of tools to help organise your life in one place to try and replace the many physical notebooks, mindmaps, bits of paper, stuff that's in my head on one place, with the ability to take an easy overview.
To use these tools to try and implement a principle of doing the right things in your life.
Time is one of the few finite totally unchangeable things in your life - its important to know how you're spending your time, you won't get a second chance.

The base data structure of the tools is a list that's rendered in a draggable, resizable accordion panel.

##### Notes
Collection of stuff you've learned and links to stuff that you want to keep track of.

##### Checklist
Daily to-do with dates and tracking - are you doing the right things, the most important things you could be doing.

##### MindMap
More complicated list - plan out possibilities and connections.

##### Projects
A list of lists - each item could link to another project, each item is easily converted to a project.

##### Reporting, Views and Tracking
Get some clarity on how you're spending your time. Are you doing the things that are really important.
Track how you're feeling, measure anything that's important to you and see how its progressing over time.
